      <description>This is post all about geo data visualization. We will have a look about Baidu map api, Google map api and create maps with folium.
This post is from what I have learned about visualizing data from 2019nCov-api. To get the direction data, there are two apis you can call - Baidu map api and Google map api. The coordinate systems is actually quite interesting. Baidu Maps uses a variant of web Mercator projection for slicing map data into tiles with an underlying latitude-longitude reference - BD-09 coordinate system while the chinese gov is using GCJ-02.</description>

      <description>The beginning of the year of rat is quite difficult for most Chinese people since the coronavirus outbreak. I have been checking the news about the progress of this outbreak. One day I watched the interview of a Chinese health official. She mentioned that there was one patient who has no idea that he has met anyone from Wuhan,the center of the outbreak. However, they used big data and found 3 people from Wuhan that have been in contact with him.</description>
