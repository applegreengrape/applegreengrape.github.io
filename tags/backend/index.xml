      <description>In my previous posts, I have talked about how to build your own Google NLP API. You are a smart developer and you got a great idea ðŸ’¡. You build an amazing API with useful functions. The only thing you are missing is a validated business case. I think the eaiset way to prove the use case is to put it in the market and see whether or not people are willing to pay for it.</description>

Well, now we know how to create a Go function to handle HTTP request and we understand the idea of Natural language Processing. Why not building your own Google NLP API?
Let&amp;rsquo;s now look at the key functions // Now we need to create a function to parse and tag all the data // There is a pre-built lib you can use - &amp;#34;gopkg.</description>
