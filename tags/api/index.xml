      <description>This post is about how to terraform up a serverless, scalable and resilient lambda API. I am using the 2019nCov-api as an example. In addition, we will have a look at terraform&amp;rsquo;s built-in functions to make a more reusable modules for api gateway and lambdas.
前面几篇都是写dev的, 今天这篇来写云架构和terraform. 如何用AWS api gateway，lambda和dynamodb做一个轻巧，可扩展的适应性强的数据接口（p.s. serverless, scalable and resilient 这个我不知道该怎么翻， 反正就是这个☁️云架构精致，小巧且耐用)
Use Case 用例 The use case is I want to build a simple API to allow user to retrieve coronavirus data.</description>

      <description>The beginning of the year of rat is quite difficult for most Chinese people since the coronavirus outbreak. I have been checking the news about the progress of this outbreak. One day I watched the interview of a Chinese health official. She mentioned that there was one patient who has no idea that he has met anyone from Wuhan,the center of the outbreak. However, they used big data and found 3 people from Wuhan that have been in contact with him.</description>

      <description>In my previous posts, I have talked about how to build your own Google NLP API. You are a smart developer and you got a great idea 💡. You build an amazing API with useful functions. The only thing you are missing is a validated business case. I think the eaiset way to prove the use case is to put it in the market and see whether or not people are willing to pay for it.</description>

      <description>In my previous posts, I have talked about building a small backend server to handle HTTP POST request. We also have tried out the Google NLP and we dived into the topic of NLTK. Well, now we know how to create a Go function to handle HTTP request and we understand the idea of Natural language Processing. Why not building your own Google NLP API?
Let&amp;rsquo;s now look at the key functions // Now we need to create a function to parse and tag all the data // There is a pre-built lib you can use - &amp;#34;gopkg.</description>
